Simple project with arduino nano

This project is based on a project and code by Dipto Pratyaksa, updated on 31/3/13
Modified for Christmas by Joshi, on Dec 17th, 2017, and by Jaques Schroeder (Hagar-SP), on Nov 27, 2024.

For this to run, you'll need:
- an arduino nano;
- some leds;
- a 10k Ohms resistor;
- a switch, to power on arduino;
- a buzzer (or a small speaker);
- a push button

The objective is as below:
- When powered on, the leds will lit up
- when you push the push button, it will start playing the songs
- when you push the button one more time, it will stop playing the song, and will return to leds lit up state.
